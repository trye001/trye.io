Your data privacy is a priority for us. We value your rights of data protection and do our best to secure your data in any meaningful way.

We collect only the necessary information and minimize the collection of your personal information. For example, we do not collect such identifiable information as names, physical addresses, birthdays, telephone numbers, credit card details, etc. On the other hand, we do collect your email address for marketing purposes, since it is crucial for our business.

## Services

We do not collect your data directly. For this purpose, we use third-party services:

* [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com)
* [Formspree](https://formspree.io)

## Compliance with GDPR

Both services which we use comply with existing [General Data Protection Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj) (GDPR for short). Both services use certified EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.

## Compliance with CCPA

Both services which we use comply with existing [California Consumer Privacy Act](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) (CCPA for short). If you live in California, you have the following rights:

* The right to know about the personal information a business collects about them and how it is used and shared;
* The right to delete personal information collected from them (with some exceptions);
* The right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information; and
* The right to non-discrimination for exercising their CCPA rights.

Please contact us using [this email](mailto:trye001@gmail.com) if you want to execute one of these rights.
